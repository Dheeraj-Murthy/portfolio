# Dheeraj M â€” Interactive Portfolio (Canvas Platformer) v2
This version adds:
- Double jump
- Back-and-forth camera scrolling
- Reduced platform spacing for smoother gameplay
- Attempts to load sprites from `./assets/warrior/` (if you upload that folder into the project, they'll be used)
- Fire-flow custom cursor that replaces system cursor
- Smooth animated link redirects

## How to use sprites
If you want the warrior sprites to be used, upload the `assets/warrior/` folder (from your repo) into the project root so path becomes `assets/warrior/<files>`.
If you prefer, compress and upload the `warrior` folder here and I'll integrate them into the zip for you.

## Run locally
serve . or open index.html (recommended to use a local server so GitHub API calls work)
